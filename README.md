This is a web application, for weather with JavaScript (Vanilla JavaScript: No Framework).

The weather app will show the weather information that it will get from the API like this,{ an Icon that shows the weather status, the temperature value (18Â°C) in Celsius unit, the weather description (clear sky), and then the user's city and country (Dhaka, BD)}.

When the user clicks on the temperature value, that will convert it from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

The API used to build the application is http://www.OpenWeatherMap.org

The icons used for the web application are created by the Graphic Designer Ashley Jager.
